# reddit-redirect

## Why use it?

A reddit user may sometimes fail to adhere to title naming standards and have their submission removed. For example, a subreddit I moderate--/r/MeetPeople--requires that titles contain certain \[tags] in order to be valid. One unfortunate effect of enforcing these rules is that some mobile or non-tech-savvy users may feel compelled to rewrite their entire post over a simple title error that takes <10 seconds to fix. And unfortunately, automoderator [doesn't provide a way to URL encode body text](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/3pc6pn/is_a_way_to_provide_a_resubmit_link_to_users_whos/) by itself. 

**reddit-redirect is a small hack which allows moderators to link to pre-filled resubmission forms without the use of an auxiliary bot.**
